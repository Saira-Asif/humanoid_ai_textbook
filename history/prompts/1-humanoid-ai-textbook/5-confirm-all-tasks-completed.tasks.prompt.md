## PROMPT_TEXT
Perfect, now just confirm if there is any other tasks that needs to be completed from tasks.md.

## RESPONSE_TEXT
I have thoroughly checked the tasks.md file and can confirm that there are NO remaining tasks that need to be completed. All 93 tasks across all 6 phases have been successfully completed and marked as [X] in the tasks.md file:

Phase 1: Research & Requirements (T001-T005) - All 5 tasks completed
Phase 2: Foundation & Structure (T006-T017) - All 12 tasks completed
Phase 3: Content Development (T018-T042) - All 25 tasks completed
Phase 4: Quality Assurance & Validation (T043-T064) - All 22 tasks completed
Phase 5: Integration & Polish (T065-T079) - All 15 tasks completed
Phase 6: Deployment & Documentation (T080-T093) - All 14 tasks completed

The entire Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook project is now complete with:
- 14 comprehensive chapters across 4 modules
- Complete documentation with learning objectives and prerequisites
- Proper deployment configuration with GitHub Actions
- Responsive design with search functionality
- Consistent styling and user experience
- All required metadata and quality standards

Total: 93/93 tasks completed.

## OUTCOME
